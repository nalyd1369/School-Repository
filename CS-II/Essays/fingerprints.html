    <h3><u>Fingerprints</u></h3>

    <h4>HTTPS Protocol</h4>
    <p>When the internet was first conceived it utilized an insecure HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). Although it worked well it proved to be too insecure warranting the creation of HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) also known as TLS(Transport Layer Security) and SSL(Secure Sockets Layer). HTTPS was created for both improved privacy and security(Gibson, n.d). HTTPS encrypts all data sent between a client and server, which allows for systems of authentication that ensure that the website you are visiting has a legitimate certificate and identity. A browser will look towards CAs (Certificate Authorities) for a digitally signed certificate, if one is found and confirmed by a trusted CA then the website will be deemed safe and secure by the HTTPS protocol. </p>

    <h4>HTTPS Proxy Appliances</h4>
    <p>However with this new security comes organizations trying to crack it. Many of the securities HTTPS offers can be negated with a Proxy Server, commonly used by schools, businesses, and other institutions. By adding an external Certificate authority an organization can force computers connected to the network trust an unsecure server. They can then manipulate that certificate authority (Gibson n.d) to redirect all traffic to the proxy server before going to the true server. This allows the network to view all user information, including personal information such as banking information, security numbers, and passwords. This is a type of MTM (Man-in-the-middle) exploit. </p>

    <h4>Fingerprints</h4>
    <p>HTTPS/SSL decryption cannot be prevented, however it can be detected. Legitimate servers have unique private and public keys meaning that we check if our data is being sent through a Proxy Application. Everyone has access to Public Keys, these cannot be used to find the Private Key, which only the organization will hold. This means that the certificate will have to utilize a different public key so that it may also have access to the private key. This means that the certificate will have to run through a different public key, allowing you to determine where your traffic is being redirected or if it’s being funneled through a proxy. </p>

    <p>All this modification to the certificate can be hard to detect purely through its data so it’s often run through a hashing algorithm which creates a Fingerprint or Hash. A hashing algorithm will take the certificate as an input and will output a unique string for that exact combo of input. If even a byte of data is changed in the input, the output hash will be completely different (Gibson, n.d). Many browsers will hash certificates and add the resulting fingerprint in the certificate info of a website, making it easier to check. </p>

    <h4>Privacy</h4>
    <p>I believe that private organizations have no right to eavesdrop or monitor the private information passing through their servers, all it takes is one bad actor with access to the network traffic logs to result in hacked accounts and stolen identities. I also think the government should have limited ability to monitor communications. It should be similar to having your car or home searched, if they need probable cause to search through important or personal places, they should need probable cause to search through important or personal data.</p>
