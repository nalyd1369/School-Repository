    <h3><u>My Education and Projects</u></h3>
    <h4>Education</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Fundamentals of Computer Science</li>
      <li>Computer Science I</li>
      <li>Computer Science II - ongoing</li>
      <li>Web Design Master Class</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In Computer Science I we learned the principles of Swift and how to plan and design larger projects, we also learned basic number conversions as well as other core principles of Computer Science</p>

    <h4>My projects</h4>
    <p>
      A recent group project for Computer Science I, was a simple game of hangman hosted on CoderMerlin, our team consisted of 3 people and we had about a month to create a game using Swift. <br><br>Our game randomly selects a word in an array of the top 1000 most common english words with 5-8 characters. Then it generates a slot for each letter in the word. Finally, it will then await key presses and check if the letter pressed is contained in the word. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed. If not, then the letter will have its color changed to red and you'll lose a life. This will repeat until either the word is filled or all lives are lost. Then press any button to display the correct win or lose screen.<br><br>We decided on Hangman because it's a simple competitive word guessing game, that provides a challenge both in creation and gameplay.<br><br>We struggled with many different things while working on our game, the main one being our concept, we originally wanted to do an RPG style pathway game, however we struggled to get the progression of the game to feel rewarding or interesting. It ended up having too many issues to continue pursuing. Once we settled on Hangman the challenges weren't done. We struggled greatly with having our dynamic hanging man display as you run out of guesses. We also found it difficult to squash bugs associated with displaying the character. The game will respond to any keypress, not just letters, and if you guess a letter you already guessed you'll still lose a life and gain a guess. We also couldn't figure out winning automatically after the word is complete, right now it requires an extra keypress to realize you won. <br>

	Our word bank consists of the top 200 most used english words, this list was pulled from this <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/master/google-10000-english-usa-no-swears-long.txt">GitHub Repo</a>. A random word is pulled from the array by the function, randomElement()

      We created multiple functions throughout the Interaction Layer that would determine various variables which then would be used to change the aspects of other objects such as the letters.
	Objects were initialized, and multiple qualities of each object had to be altered throughout logically through the "OnKeyPress" function
	The preSetup provided the initial qualities of the different objects.
