    <h3><u>Biases</u></h3>

    <p class="APAHead">Dylan Pettijohn<br>Allen High School<br>Computer Science II<br>Mr. Ben-Yaakov<br>December 8, 2022</p><br>
    <p>Regardless of how fair a person tries to be, everybody has biases that affect their decision-making and creative expression. While these biases can help simplify thought processes and make us feel better, they are still shortcuts that can adversely affect the projects we work on. I’m going to analyze some of the biases I’ve found within myself, and explore ways to overcome them.
    </p>

    <p>A trait that I’ve acquired over the stressful and fast-paced years of high school is that I prefer to get things done quickly so I don’t have old projects weighing me down over the week. Unfortunately, this sometimes causes me to rush through assignments without fully understanding the topic. This is commonly referred to as expediency bias (NeuroLeadership,2022). This bias can lead to me getting ahead in group projects and being forced to wait for people to catch up. It could also cause my final product to not line up with the group’s vision. For example, in this year's ISP while making the user interface of the scheduling program, I could preemptively add elements that don’t line up with what the back-end developers are creating, which would create a need to go back and change perfectly good aspects of the product. Another issue is finishing things too quickly, and pressuring other people to work faster and make mistakes. I can try to overcome this by forcing myself to pace throughout the project and by asking my teammates how far along they are, to stay on track. This will ensure that I won’t cause issues by moving ahead and that I won’t rush my colleagues.
    </p>

    <p>Another very common bias that almost everyone falls for is the planning fallacy. Planning bias is when we assume the best-case scenario will occur and don’t account for speed bumps and issues that are bound to appear along the way(Timely,2022). This negatively affects the team, because while creating the schedule for work we overestimate how quickly we can complete the task (just like project MAE). While planning I only think of how long things will take if we don’t encounter any unexpected difficulties. This will likely occur in our isp while planning out how long we will need to dedicate for each part of the scheduler. This can be avoided by giving ourselves extra time on top of what we think we need or allowing for some parts of a project to be shortened if others need more attention.
    </p>

    <p>An additional bias I noticed I have is confirmation bias. Confirmation bias can be defined as only looking for evidence that confirms one’s own belief. I’ve noticed when doing other projects that I tend to only listen to opinions or facts that line up with my view on the matter. This could come up in the ISP where I could overlook facts about the model scheduler because it’s not how I view things should be. Another way this could affect the ISP is when someone voices their opinion and I could overlook or ignore it because it doesn’t line up with my views. I can overcome this by training myself to learn and listen to other people’s views even if I disagree and take those views into account when making decisions.
    </p>

    <p>The final bias I see in myself is the framing effect. I tend to frame information in a way that benefits me the most. For example, on the ISP I could have important information and I might frame it in a way that leads to how I want the project done. Another example could be, making a mistake or messing up some code, but trying to frame it as a feature or intentional. I can overcome this by trying to be impartial and just stating the facts as is.
    </p>

    <p>All of these fallacies and biases could appear within our ISP groups. The best way to counter this is to make everyone aware and try to avoid making these mistakes. If we all band together and try to stick to the facts, our final product will end up much better and the process will have been much smoother. Due to this, it’s extremely important that I as well as our colleagues hold each other accountable and make our best effort to work as an efficient team.
