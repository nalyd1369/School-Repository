    <h3><u>ISP Considerations</u></h3>

      In the writing to market his product, he makes multiple typos showing a lack of care for his project. He demonstrates short and unclear goals that make very broad promises without detailing and of the specifics of the project. He writes very short descriptions of what he wanted to accomplish, making me wonder if he even knows what his goals are. I don’t feel confident in join the group, due to the lack of care, and lack of direction of the group.<br><br>

      The project made by this group is impractical and would be detrimental to the rest of society. School buses already leave at time to where students get to class on time. Turning the lights green for only school bus routes would be incredibly inefficient for almost everyone else on the road. Overall, the idea is not well thought out and should not be implemented.<br><br>

      Their group project idea is to make a city planner calendar that is more accessible. This would ensure that more people are more aware of the events that are happening in their community. Their main competitor is google and I think that anything they come up with, would be overshadowed by how  gigantic google is. I think a better solution to this would be to make the already existing website better or make a new one on google. Additionally I don’t think this is the correct problem they should be addressing. The problem is that people don’t care enough to find out about events in their city and go to them, not that people care and they can’t find out about the events.<br><br>

      This project's main purpose is to detect parking lot spaces and show users which spots are open. The app will show different icons depending on the parking location. For example if a spot is taken it will show red and if it’s open it will display green. The first problem I have with this idea is that people would be using this application while driving which could lead to people not paying attention and getting into accidents while driving. Another problem I have is that setting up motion detectors and sensors into every single parking space would be extremely expensive and not practical.<br><br>

      I like the idea because it seems generally useful. It is a service that can be almost universally applied to anyone that is cooking. The reason I decided not to do it however is the fact that making an effective app like this would require hundreds of different combinations of ingredients. Additionally, apps like this already exist and this isn’t adding anything new that would set it apart from the competitors. I fear that this would just be overlooked and over shadowed as there is nothing innovative that would encourage people to switch over.<br><br>

      This caught my eye because it seemed very unique. But I do not want to do this because it doesn’t seem like something that people would buy. A spinning TV seems like it would take up more space than it would save. This seems like a gimmick that isn’t really needed, as you can just turn the tv manually if you really need to rotate it. Additionally, this product does not seem like something that requires computer science.<br><br>

      No specific target audience mentioned which means that the product is not going to sell since they have no audience in mind. No desire to compete with competitors and poor marketing campaigns. Additionally, the revenue stream isn't consistent as in-game goods are their only form of monetization. Adding ads may help even out the revenue stream and increase the overall viability of the business venture.<br><br>

      While a good idea, it’s a very competitive market. There’s already veterans in this industry like iBUYPower and NZXT Build. Additionally, they have no unique idea to compete in this market. The proposal also requires high startup costs for collecting parts and start selling. Also, teens interested in PC gaming are more likely to buy parts on their own and build the pc themselves.<br><br>

      This idea seems good, but it is very difficult to implement. Also, companies such as Porsche and BMW have already started to use this technology in their cars so it is only a matter of implementing that same technology on a bigger scale. Idea seems good on the surface but it is already in the market which makes it unoriginal and a very simple project with the right resources.<br><br>

      I did consider this business plan heavily as the core mission behind this plan is fundamentally a good mission. Intended on making people healthy and getting healthy groceries to homes around the world. But the reason I rejected it is due to the immense competition to the plan due to the existence of Walmart, Kroger, and Whole Foods and their home delivery programs.<br><br>

      This was in my consideration due to the fact that Social Media is very popular, and most businesses relating to it are very successful. But I do not see this particular program as being successful simply due to the fact that the market is saturated with programs and projects that do the same.<br><br>

      I heavily considered this plan because I created it. My previous group and I worked very hard on this proposal plan. But I decided to reject it due to the severe software complexity that a project such as this would require, and the fact that a small high school group would not be able to afford this kind of program.<br><br>

      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/brook-asnake/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a> - Brook Asnake<br>
      I liked the core plan behind this project, as well as the idea. To make a simple program which would be able to help you schedule and plan out your day is a very good idea. But to me it feels too mundane and easy, which is why I rejected it.<br><br>

      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/christopher-carter/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a> - Chris Carter<br>
      I rejected this as I did not really have an idea of what kind of project that it is. I would’ve liked a proposal plan page like the other pages that I could actually view through and consider this project. But due to that not existing, I decided to reject it.<br><br>

      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/evan-bowerman/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a> - Evan Bowerman<br>
      Similar to the reasons I rejected Brook’s project plan, I rejected the project proposal by Evan. While is is a very good application and program, and could potentially be successful, the software behind it is not very challenging and to make it interesting will be hard.<br><br>

      We choose to endorse our own project because we feel it has a valid marketing strategy, has a target audience in mind, and has a problem that we provide a good solution to. Our project idea is to implement RFID scanners into entrances of schools so that the schools can see who has an ID when entering the school and who doesn’t. This ensures that people who don’t go to the school can’t enter undetected and that students without ID’s are caught. This would replace the security guards that usually check the ID’s. This would free up the labor and would ensure that people can’t just sneak into the building in a large crowd and remain undetected. The project also isn’t very costly because the RFID chips are very inexpensive and the scanners only need to be implemented in the entrances of the schools.<br><br>
