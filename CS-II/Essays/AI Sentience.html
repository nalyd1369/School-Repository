    <h3><u>AI Sentience</u></h3>

    <p class="APAHead">Dylan Pettijohn<br>Allen High School<br>Computer Science II<br>Mr. Ben-Yaakov<br>September 16th, 2022</p><br>
    <h4>The Future of AI</h4>
    <p>Sentient AI is rapidly transitioning from a work of science fiction to reality everyday. It's been played out in fiction many times over; sometimes as a world ending event vying for power against humanity, and others as the means to a utopia where human labor is replaced by machines. Sentient AI will be a turning point for humanity as we will finally have a match to our intellect. This new intellect could be used on long, arduous, and repetitive jobs, to eliminate human error.</p>
    <h4>Effects on Society</h4>
    <p>Knowing that AI Sentience is a possibility within the coming decades, how will this development shape society? Surprisingly, it probably won’t change very much. Already we see more and more jobs being displaced due to machines. Cahiers, Tellers, and soon Taxis. Once an AI is perfected it could become a doctor with all of humanity's knowledge of medicine, or a therapist with a complex understanding of how to respond, help, and treat humans, or any number of high-skill, knowledgeable jobs. Still to take these positions, AI must gain not only sentience, but also needs to understand human sentiment, emotion, and behavior (Musser, 2022).</p>
    <p>AI is fundamentally better than humans, they don’t get fatigued, they don’t need sleep or lunch breaks, they don’t lose focus or make human errors. AI would be able to have accidents without losing lives, problem-solve in unforeseen circumstances, and generally be more adaptable than humans, without making mistakes that lead to the loss of life (Kwo, 2021).</p>
    <h4>Concerns</h4>
    <p>One of the most common concerns brought up about AI is the loss of jobs due to sentient AI. While the implementation of AI would most likely cause some jobs to be phased out, it would mostly impact low skilled and repetitive, or dangerous jobs. AI taking over these positions can be described as nothing short of amazing, as millions of people will be able to funnel their time into more creative and productive tasks. This has been the pattern of the world for centuries, technology advances and removes low-skill labor, then there’s an influx into high-skill creative jobs and large new sectors open up that previously weren’t needed.</p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Sentient AI would be a massive development and serve to push humanity to the next stage of high-skill, productive work. Despite the population of world-ending terminator-like robots rising up and destroying the world, people appreciate the results of AI daily. AI has been seeping into our lives, with self-driving cars, and self-checkouts, and predictive apps which many people rely on daily. We’re right on the cusp of eliminating menial labor, and soon AI will bring us closer to the utopia we’ve been dreaming of.
