    <h3><u>AI Sentience</u></h3>
    <p>In our rapidly changing society, we’ve gained many newer advances in technology. One of the most prevalent is Artificial Intelligence and new neural networks. AI is a widely debated topic as it has uses both beneficial and potentially harmful, as with everything there are some risks. AI is becoming widely used in almost all fields such as medicine, simulations run for science and engineering, and home devices. For example, many new personal assistants are being rolled out, like Siri and Alexa. These new assistants can automate certain tasks, control smart homes, answer questions, and communicate with others.
<br>      Unfortunately, the reason for its popularity is also the reason for its dislike. Artificial intelligence has the unique ability to teach itself and learn based on previous mistakes. For example, in data science AI is being used to match faces from video footage to real people in a database. For every person it gets right or wrong it becomes even better at detecting and matching new faces. While a self-improving system sounds amazing there comes a point where you have to ask the question: what if it improves too much or gets in the wrong hands?
<br>      A trusted government agency would obviously be invested in such technology, as it would improve national security, but what if a foreign agency got a hold of similar technology? They could use it to target individuals and cause them harm. Luckily, that requires tons of infrastructure and is likely years away. How about something less resource intensive and currently available. Deep Fakes. With new image generating AI technology you can basically create “evidence” for anything. You can portray celebrities, politicians, or someone you don’t like doing just about anything. Then take these pictures and spread hard to disprove rumors due to the photorealistic proof attached. Many public figures could be embarrassed or have their reputations ruined by falsified images.
<br>      Due to this, I think that AI is beneficial in certain situations. However, it should be heavily guarded and measures should be taken to prevent misuse. For example, image generators shouldn’t be able to produce realistic looking faces, and facial recognition should be limited to a certain scale. With the power of technology that’s being created, the general public shouldn’t be allowed full unrestricted use under any circumstance.
