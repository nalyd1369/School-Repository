    <h3><u>Optimal Sorting</u></h3>
    <p>
      A team project done using GitHub and Swift, in collaboration with Srijishnu Devarapalli, Brayden Edington, and Md Raeed.<br>

      Our group created a simple bubble sort algorithm in Swift. We then went and made 3 revisions to improve our sort time, making considerable progress with every revision. We ended with a time we are quite proud of for our first algorith. Our flow chart is pictured below.

    <h3><u>Bubble, Selection, and Insertion Sort comparison</u></h3>
    <p>To explore the relationship between the amount of data and the time it takes to sort I developed 3 sorting alrgoritms. One utilizing bubble sort which compares two strings and if the smaller is first, flips them. An Insertion Sort which takes one string and compares it repeatedly until it's put in place. And finally a Selection Sort which scans throught the entire unsorted word bank and notes the smallest letter or word then at the end moves it to the top of the sorted list and repeats. All of these algorithms are useful in different circumstances, however one commonality between them all was an exponential time increase as the word list got larger. This makes sense when you think about how it takes probably about a minute to sort a deck of cards, however it would take closer to an hour to sort 10. This shows that althought the amount of data increased tenfold, the time it takes to sort increased sixtyfold.</p>
