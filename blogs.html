<p>The school is removing the Bring Your Own Device, BYOD, network. I think this is an absolutely braindead idea and a terrible decision by the IT department. They're forcing us to use the crappy school chromebooks in place of our capable devices and removing most network access to phones. This is a horrible choice and they're only doing it so they have more control over the students. Literally 1984.</p>
