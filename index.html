    <h3><u>About Me</u></h3>
    <p>Hi, I'm Dylan Pettijohn a student at Allen High School. I'm focusing on backend work mainly in JavaScript and Python. I'm passionate about reaching my full potential as a student and eventual software designer! I'm hoping to progress enough as a student to be able to take AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A.</p>
    <h3>The importance of a Digital Portfolio</h3>
    <p>A digital portfolio is the resume of the new age, especially for jobs involving technology, such as computer software. It's a display of your coding skills as well as your accomplishments all in one place. Instead of long, boring, and visually unappealing resumes you can instead send the link to a personal website containing your history, accomplishments, and skills. This Digital Portfolio is important to me because it's a safe area for me to store my history of accomplisments in order to eventually show an employer. If we work on this Digital Portfolio enough it could be the gateway to a good future job.</p>
