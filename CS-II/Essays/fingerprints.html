    <h3><u>Fingerprints</u></h3>

      The internet is simple on the surface but as you look deeper you realize the layers of security and encryption baked into everything you do. One of the largest universal forms of security on the internet is HTTPS, meaning secure HTTP. The purpose of HTTPS is to provide users with a guarantee of privacy, allowing them to be confident in transferring personal information online. This is through the use of encryption that nobody, even the creator, can break. It also prevents 3rd parties from listening in on a private connection between user and server. Unfortunately, organizations are trying to circumvent this using HTTPS Proxy Appliances. A proxy is a middleman between you and the internet, it's capable of viewing all data going in and out of the network, including sensitive information.
      <br>A MITM or a man in the middle is a term for someone who mediates between two places. It presents risks because it offers another point of failure for a malicious attacker to present. Attacks usually involve IP spoofing, ARP spoofing, HTTPS spoofing, SSL hijacking, etc. A hash is a complex mathematical algorithm that can help prevent most spoofing attacks. A good hash is efficient in processing information while having the most difference between very similar addresses. Another system of detecting fake addresses is through Certificate Authorities which requires sites to verify their identity and then assigns them a unique address to certify their authenticity.
      <br>You can prevent SSL interceptions by using trusted Wi-Fi networks and checking the security certificates of your network traffic. It can be detected by monitoring and verifying all the web certificates that get visited. Unfortunately, keep in mind that there will be some false positives and negatives. A false positive and negative is when something returns positive or negative but that result is wrong.
      <br>An unfortunate reality is that large corporations will monitor all the web traffic and data that they can, we need to work together to prevent them from eavesdropping on and misusing our information. The only time monitoring network traffic should be allowable is when itâ€™s by the government with probable cause of illegal activities.
